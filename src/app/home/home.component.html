<p><b>Pair generator</b> is able to generate random teams of pairs which can help distribute team members for 
working in groups or do pair programming.</p>
<br />
<p>Add members from which pairs will be generated using <code>member-add</code> command. 
Members should be provided separated by space. Subsequent call to <code>member-add</code> command 
will replace the previous member list.
</p>
<p><code>/pair-generator member-add Diana Clark Kara Bruce Barry</code></p>
<br />
<p>If some members should not be paired with each other, use <code>member-exclusion</code> command.
Members should be provided separated by space. Subsequent call to <code>member-exclusion</code> command 
will replace the previous member list.
</p>
<p><code>/pair-generator member-exclusion Diana,Clark Kara,Clark</code></p>

<p>To see configuration of pair generator, type <code>/pair-generator show-config</code> command.</p>
